* Vasudha Nair
* Kristy Bao


Description / Outline


Our project will look at COVID-19 data and determine which factors impact case counts and death rates, including:
* Policy (red states vs. blue states)
* Population age
* Median income
* Travel rates
* Population density


Questions to Address
* What kinds of actions/policies impact case count and death rates?
   * Red states vs. blue states case counts & death rates
   * Different trends over time in red states vs. blue states
   * How do mask mandates impact COVID transmission? 
* Do areas with higher average/median age of population have higher death rates?
* Do areas with lower median income have higher case counts?
* Do areas with greater travel have higher case counts?
* Do areas with higher population density have higher case counts?


Datasets to Use: 


John Hopkins Data, including:
* 1_county_level_confirmed_cases.csv
* 2_cases_and_deaths_by_county_timeseries.csv
* 3_cases_and_deaths_by_state_timeseries.csv
* States with the current highest per-capita rates of cases


TBD dataset on mask mandates (if this exists)


TBD dataset on travel


TBD dataset on political affiliation of states/counties 


Census data (median income, average age of population, population density, etc.)
