COVID-19 Analysis

Group Members: Sybile Cherenfant, Megan Cogguillo, Vasudha Nai, Brandon Lee

Project description:

Our project analyzed county-level data from Johns Hopkins on COVID-19 cases and deaths, assessing the relationship between certain demographic characteristics and COVID outcomes.

In particular, we sought to understand:

  Do counties with older populations have higher case counts and/or death rates? (Brandon)
  
  Do counties with higher poverty rates have higher case counts / death rates? (Sybile)
  
  Do counties with limited health insurance coverage have higher cases counts / death rates? (Vasudha)
  
  Is there a relationship between political affiliation of each county (based on 2016 presidential election) and case counts / death rates? (Megan)
